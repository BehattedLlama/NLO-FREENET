Scripts used to process and analyze Freenet/Hyphanet outgoing request logs:
  analyzeAllRequests.ps1: Parses logs for each downloader/relayer node and separates logs by file based on keys contained in each downloadKeys_File*.txt present, creating folder structure for each test file. Individual logs are saved in /File*/Relayer* for each File/Relayer and /File*/downloader for each file. Copies necessary scripts and supporting .txt to new folders.
  filterRequests.pl: Called by analyzeAllRequests.ps1, output is downloadRequests.txt (all download requests matching downloadKeys), requestsLocs.txt (the request location field from each request), avgPeers.txt (number of average peers for duration of download), and sentToPeer.txt (counts how many requests went to each peer that received at least one request, by IP address).
  requestTimingDuplicatesInserts.pl: Called by analyzeAllRequests.ps1, detects duplicate keys, inserts vs data requests, HTL statistics, and produces summaries: requestTimestamps*.txt, keys*.txt, requests*.txt,       requestIntervals*.txt, avgIntervals*.txt, duplicates.txt, inserts.txt, dataRequestsOnly*.txt, dataRequestsNum.txt, and HTL.txt for each * relayer. 
  calcProbabilities.pl: Applies the Levine Method to per-peer request data produced in previous steps, generates a "probabilityReport" output identifying observed runs and whether those runs "pass" the Levine Method's formula. Calculates false positive rate.
